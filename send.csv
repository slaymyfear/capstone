Mean with 2Pac, Young Noble","Hurt-M-Badd, 2Pac","Death Row Records (2), Makaveli Records","In today's music news: the ever-controversial Tupac Shakur has just released another album under the alias ""Makaveli."" Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artists' street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail inter-chart movement. Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album, resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character of not only Mr. Shakur but of Death Row Records as well. Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac's â€“ excuse me â€“ Makaveli's verbal assault on Mobb Sleep, Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers. JAY-Z from ""Hawaiian Sophie"" fame , Big Little whatever, and several other corny-sounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release. The question everybody wants to know is: why'd they get this nigga started? 2Pac â€“ rather Makaveli â€“ was not available for comment but released this statement: It's not about East or West It's about niggas and bitches Power and money, ridaz and punks Which side are you on? *Heartbeat* *Gunshots* *Encroaching footsteps* These niggas is still fuckin' talkin'?

Window Pain (Outro),J. Cole,KOD,2018,Hip-Hop/Rap,Various studios,57,---,J. Cole,"Dreamville, Roc Nation, Interscope Records","This song starts with a narrative of a little girl who discusses the story of her cousin getting shot. For the duration of this song, Cole is self-reflective and contemplative as he discusses the things heâ€¦ Read More One night When me and my mom was about to go to bed All the doors was locked Then when I had fell asleep My mom had heard three gun shots It was to my cousin, his name was Rod The one that came to pick me up He had been shot right through the face, right in the neck And he got shot right in the stomach I put my hand to the sky, I sing Grateful for the blessings you bring Thank you for the ones I love Forgive me for the times I was Down and confused, I know What I reap is what I will sow Once again I find myself Back with you from my hell All I ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back Get some money plus respect and now look, I got all of that All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry All I wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate All I wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry Right now I'm starin' out the window of my Range and contemplating, am I sane? Have I sacrificed for fame? My occupation's on my brain Thought that I could change it all if I had change But the niggas that I came up with way back is still the same I be tryna give 'em game like Santa did when Christmas came They be listenin' but it's clear to me they did not hear a thing It go in one ear and out the other like a bullet out the muzzle of a pistol shot by brothers standin' point-blank range Niggas bang in the Ville, I always thought that shit was strange How you claim blood or cuz when that was just a LA thing? I don't mean no disrespect towards your set, no, I'm just sayin' That it seem like for acceptance niggas will do anything Niggas will rep any gang, niggas will bust any head Niggas will risk everything, point him out and then he dead Shootin' up where his granny live, ""blaow, blaow!"", his granny duck He don't give a fuck, he's on Henny and Xanny'd up Blowin' Tammy up, bitch, when you gon' give them panties up? He gon' plant a seed, but best believe he ain't man enough Just because yo' dick can spray semen, it don't mean that you ready to let go of yo' childish ways The results are deadly Because that child will suffer and that's what can most affect me The little girl I met this past summer said, ""Don't forget me"" I won't forget you, how could I with all you went through? A bullet hit yo' cousin in Temple while he was with you And while you was talkin', I was tearin' up, where's the tissue? If you was my sister then I would kiss you and tell you that I'm sorry for the pain you had to live through I know I'm blessed because yo' stress is realer than anything I done been through I put my hand to the sky, I sing Grateful for the blessings you bring Thank you for the ones I love Forgive me for the times I was Down and confused, I know What I reap is what I will sow Once again I find myself Back with you from my hell All I ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back Get some money plus respect and now look, I got all of that All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry All I wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate All I wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry It's not that big Well at least, um God had saved him 'cause he still alive So why do y'all think that bad stuff happen? Like why can't the world just be all nice things? Because God is tryna, um Warn-warn us or teach us a lesson that we need to learn Or He's tryna warn us of He's comin' back to, um, see us and take us home and redo the world He's comin' back to, um, have us be His children and for us to see Him for the first time so we can rejoice with Him and have our time And after we do that, He's gonna restart the world K.O.D Choose wisely!",anger,"Spirituality, Nostalgia, Street Life"
